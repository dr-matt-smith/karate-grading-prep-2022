Here are what I think are the 10 most useful karate terms to know when starting Shotokan:



## The 10 most useful Karate / dojo words to know (pronunciation guide in parentheses)

- **Sensei** - instructor
  - (sen-say)

- **Rei** - bow
  - (ray)
  - e.g. sensei rei (bow to instructor at beginning/ending of class when kneeling)

- **Yoi** - ready
  - (yoy – where the ‘oy’ is as in ‘boy’)

- **Hajime** - start
  - (ha-jimmy)

- **Yame** - stop/finish/step back into yoi
  - (yam-ay)

- **Dojo** - training hall
  - (doe-joe)

- **Mokuso** - close your eyes
  - (mock-so)
  - May be followed by: mokuso yame: stop closing your eyes

- **Osu** - yes / student says this to acknowledge what the sensei has said
  - (oss / oos)

- **Kiai** - spirited roar! (should be something short and powerful like “aye!!!!”)
